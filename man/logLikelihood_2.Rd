\title{Compute Log-Likelihood Penalty for Random Effects}
\usage{
logLikelihood_2(u, theta, K)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{A numeric vector of length \code{K} containing the random effects (frailties).}

\item{theta}{A positive numeric scalar, representing the variance component of the random effects.}

\item{K}{An integer representing the number of clusters (i.e., the length of \code{u}).}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar representing the log-likelihood penalty contribution from the random effects.
}
\description{
This function computes the second component of the log-likelihood (penalty term)
associated with the random effects (frailty terms) in a mixed-effects model.
}
\details{
The penalty is derived from the Gaussian assumption on the random effects and
involves both the dimension of the random effects vector and the variance parameter \code{theta}.
}
\examples{
u <- rnorm(5, 0, 1)
theta <- 0.5
K <- length(u)
logLikelihood_2(u, theta, K)
