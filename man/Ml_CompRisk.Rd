\title{Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Cause 1 in Competing Risks}
\usage{
Ml_CompRisk(data, max_iter = 100, tol = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing:
\describe{
\item{times}{Observed survival or censoring times.}
\item{status}{Event indicator: 0 = censored, 1 = cause 1 (event of interest), 2+ = other causes.}
\item{Covariates}{All columns from the 4th onward are considered as covariates.}
}}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of Newton-Raphson iterations (default = 100).}

\item{tol}{Convergence tolerance for the change in parameter estimates (default = 1e-6).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector \code{beta} of estimated regression coefficients for the cause-specific hazard of cause 1.
}
\description{
Performs maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the effect of covariates on the cause-specific hazard function of cause 1 in a competing risks framework.
}
\details{
The function fits a Cox-type model for the subdistribution hazard of cause 1, treating all other causes (including censoring) as censored (i.e., status != 1 becomes 0).
It uses a Newton-Raphson procedure to maximize the partial likelihood.

The design matrix is reordered internally by event time to facilitate risk set computation.
